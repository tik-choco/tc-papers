// Cross-app backup publisher. Continuously and automatically publishes a
// JSON snapshot of every paper's review data (lib/store.ts's `tc-papers:reviews-v1`)
// onto the shared bus (lib/sharedBus.ts) under topic "papers-backup", so
// tc-storage's drive (the sibling app, same origin in production) shows
// tc-papers' data as a file without any user action. See
// protocol/docs/data-contracts/docs/SHARED_BUS.md for the shared-bus
// contract — tc-storage's consumer is built against the exact
// PapersBackupItem/PapersBackupMeta shape below (meta v:1, item id
// "tc-papers-backup"), so keep that outer shape in sync deliberately rather
// than reshaping opportunistically. tc-storage treats the encrypted payload
// as an opaque file, so the inner JSON schema (the raw Paper[] array) is
// free to evolve independently. PDF bytes themselves live in IndexedDB and
// are never included — this backs up review metadata only.
//
// Ported verbatim (structure + comments) from tc-books's
// src/lib/booksBackupPublisher.ts, itself ported from tc-town's
// townBackupPublisher.ts (see docs/CONTRACTS.md). Encryption model mirrors
// tc-note's storage-drive-inbox publisher: the plaintext bundle is never
// uploaded to the mistlib block store as-is (it may be P2P-visible) — it's
// encrypted here with a fresh random AES-256-GCM key, the ciphertext is
// uploaded via mistlib's storage_add to get a CID, and the key/iv travel
// inline in `meta` alongside the CID. Same-origin localStorage is the trust
// boundary for that inline key, per the established pattern.
//
// Change detection: papers carry a transient `progress` field that ticks on
// every scan/OCR/generate step, so publishing unconditionally on every
// trigger would churn forever (new CID, new key, new bus event on every
// progress tick even though nothing worth backing up changed). Instead this
// module hashes the bundle with each paper's `progress` blanked out and
// compares that content signature against the last successfully published
// one (persisted in localStorage under tc-papers:backup-publish-state-v1),
// skipping the publish (and leaving the stored signature untouched) when
// unchanged. The stored signature is only updated after a fully successful
// publish, so a failed attempt retries on the next trigger.
//
// Best-effort throughout: guarded on Web Crypto availability, every failure
// is caught and logged via console.warn, never thrown — a failed publish
// must never break the app.
